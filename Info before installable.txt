How to Install and Run Split by Column
1. Download the Application
Download the latest version of SplitByColumn.exe from the official release page or the link provided by the author.
Save the file to a folder on your computer (for example, your Desktop or Downloads folder).
2. Run the Application
Double-click SplitByColumn.exe to start the app.
If you see a Windows Defender SmartScreen warning, click “More info” and then “Run anyway.” (This is normal for new apps that are not yet widely distributed.)
No installation is required — the app runs directly.
3. Using the App
Click “📁 Load Excel/CSV” to select your data file.
Choose your output folder.
Select one or more columns to split by (hold Ctrl or Shift for multi-select).
Click “▶ START SPLIT” to process your file.
When finished, a ZIP file containing all split files will be created in your chosen output folder.
Check the “Activity Log” panel for details and any errors.
4. System Requirements
Windows 10 or later (64-bit recommended)
No need to install Python or any extra software
The app is self-contained
5. Troubleshooting
If you see errors about missing DLLs or the app does not start, ensure your system is up to date with Windows Updates.
If you have antivirus software, it may warn about new EXE files. You can safely allow the app if downloaded from the official source.
